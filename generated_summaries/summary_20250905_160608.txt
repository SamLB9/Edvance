1. Key definitions and concepts
1.1 Definitions
- Conditional probability: P(B|A) = probability of B given A has occurred.
- Prior probability: the initial probability of an event (before new information).
- Posterior probability: the revised probability after new information.
- Likelihood: P(B|A), the probability of the observed evidence B under hypothesis A.
- Marginal (or total) probability: P(B) = overall probability of B.
- Joint probability: P(A and B) = probability both A and B occur.
- Independence: A and B independent if P(A|B) = P(A) (equivalently P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)).

1.2 Basic relationships
- P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
- P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)
- If A and B independent: P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)

2. Main formulas
2.1 Bayes' theorem (two events)
- P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)

2.2 Law of total probability (denominator for Bayes)
- For a partition {A1, A2, ..., An}: P(B) = sum over i [P(B|Ai)P(Ai)]
- Two-event special case: P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)

2.3 Bayes' theorem (generalized for multiple events)
- For partition {A1,...,An}: P(Ak|B) = P(B|Ak)P(Ak) / [sum over j P(B|Aj)P(Aj)]

2.4 Odds form (useful for likelihood ratios)
- Posterior odds = Likelihood ratio × Prior odds
- [P(A|B) / P(A^c|B)] = [P(B|A) / P(B|A^c)] × [P(A) / P(A^c)]

3. Computation methods and examples
3.1 Intuitive (frequency/table) method — steps
1 - Assume a convenient total N (e.g., N = 100,000).
2 - Convert probabilities to counts by multiplying N.
3 - Fill a contingency table with counts for each combination.
4 - Compute posterior as count(A and B) / count(B).

3.2 Example: cigar smoking (two-category Bayes via table)
- Given: P(male)=0.51, P(female)=0.49, P(cigar|male)=0.095, P(cigar|female)=0.017.
- Assume N = 100,000.
- Males = 51,000. Cigar-smoking males = 0.095 × 51,000 = 4,845.
- Females = 49,000. Cigar-smoking females = 0.017 × 49,000 = 833.
- Total cigar smokers = 4,845 + 833 = 5,678.
- P(male | cigar) = 4,845 / 5,678 ≈ 0.853.

3.3 Example: defective ELT (generalized Bayes)
- Given: P(A)=0.80, P(B)=0.15, P(C)=0.05.
- Defect rates: P(D|A)=0.04, P(D|B)=0.06, P(D|C)=0.09.
- Numerator for P(A|D) = P(D|A)P(A) = 0.04 × 0.80 = 0.032.
- Denominator = 0.032 + 0.06 × 0.15 + 0.09 × 0.05 = 0.032 + 0.009 + 0.0045 = 0.0455.
- P(A|D) = 0.032 / 0.0455 ≈ 0.703.

4. Important relationships and connections
- Bayes requires the law of total probability to compute P(B) (denominator).
- Posterior becomes new prior for sequential updating with additional evidence.
- Independence simplifies conditional expressions and Bayes calculations.
- Likelihood ratios (P(B|A)/P(B|A^c)) quantify how evidence shifts beliefs.
- Frequency/table method avoids algebraic substitution errors and aids intuition.

5. Quick reference (compact formulas)
- Conditional: P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
- Joint: P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)
- Law of total probability: P(B) = sum_i P(B|Ai)P(Ai)
- Bayes (two events): P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)
- Bayes (multiple): P(Ak|B) = P(B|Ak)P(Ak) / sum_j P(B|Aj)P(Aj)
- Odds form: [P(A|B)/P(A^c|B)] = [P(B|A)/P(B|A^c)] × [P(A)/P(A^c)]
