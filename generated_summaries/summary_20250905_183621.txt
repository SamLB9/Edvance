1. Key definitions and concepts
- Conditional probability: P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A).  
- Prior probability: initial probability of an event before new information (e.g., P(A)).  
- Posterior probability: revised probability after new information (e.g., P(A|B)).  
- Joint (multiplication) rule: P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B).  
- Independence: A and B independent iff P(A and B) = P(A)P(B) (equivalently P(A|B) = P(A)).

2. Core formulas
- Basic Bayes' theorem:
  P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)
- Conditional probability (alternative form using joint probability):
  P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
- Multiplication rule (useful to compute joint probabilities):
  P(A and B) = P(A) P(B|A)

3. Law of total probability and generalized Bayes
- Law of total probability (for partition A1,...,Ak):
  P(B) = sum_{i=1..k} P(Ai) P(B|Ai)
- Generalized Bayes (for event Ak in a partition A1,...,Ak):
  P(Ak|B) = P(Ak) P(B|Ak) / [sum_{i=1..k} P(Ai) P(B|Ai)]
- Use these when there are multiple mutually exclusive, exhaustive causes Ai explaining B.

4. Intuitive/table method (recommended practical procedure)
1 - Assume a convenient total population N (e.g., 100, 1,000, or 100,000).  
2 - Convert prior probabilities P(Ai) to counts: count(Ai) = N * P(Ai).  
3 - For each Ai, compute count(Ai and B) = count(Ai) * P(B|Ai).  
4 - Sum counts for B over all Ai to get total count(B).  
5 - Compute desired posterior as count(Ak and B) / count(B) (equivalent to Bayes' formula).  

5. Worked examples (brief)
- Example: Manufacturer / defect (three categories A,B,C)
  Given: P(A)=0.80, P(B)=0.15, P(C)=0.05; P(D|A)=0.04, P(D|B)=0.06, P(D|C)=0.09.
  Compute P(A|D):
  Numerator = 0.80 * 0.04 = 0.032.
  Denominator = 0.032 + 0.15*0.06 + 0.05*0.09 = 0.032 + 0.009 + 0.0045 = 0.0455.
  P(A|D) = 0.032 / 0.0455 ≈ 0.703 (same as 320/455).
- Example: Gender / cigar smoking
  Given: P(Male)=0.51, P(Female)=0.49; P(Cigar|Male)=0.095, P(Cigar|Female)=0.017.
  Using N = 100,000:
  Males = 51,000 → male cigar = 51,000*0.095 = 4,845.
  Females = 49,000 → female cigar = 49,000*0.017 = 833.
  Total cigar = 4,845 + 833 = 5,678.
  P(Male|Cigar) = 4,845 / 5,678 ≈ 0.853.

6. Important relationships and quick reminders
- Bayes updates priors into posteriors using likelihoods P(B|Ai).  
- Always verify denominator (P(B) or total count(B)) > 0.  
- Using counts (table method) reduces algebra errors and clarifies numerators/denominators.  
- For k causes, compute all P(Ai)P(B|Ai) and normalize the target term.  
- If events are independent, Bayes’ updating is trivial because P(B|Ai) = P(B) for all i.

7. Quick checklist for solving Bayes problems
- Identify the partition {Ai} and the observed event B.  
- Write priors P(Ai) and likelihoods P(B|Ai).  
- Compute P(B) via the law of total probability.  
- Apply Bayes: P(Ak|B) = P(Ak)P(B|Ak)/P(B) or use the table method.
