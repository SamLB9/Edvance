Section 1 — Overview
1.1 Purpose
- Bayes' theorem revises prior probabilities when new evidence is observed.
- It converts likelihoods and priors into posterior probabilities.

1.2 Key definitions
- Prior probability: P(H) — probability assigned to hypothesis H before new evidence.
- Likelihood: P(E|H) — probability of observing evidence E if H is true.
- Marginal (evidence) probability: P(E) — total probability of evidence under all hypotheses.
- Posterior probability: P(H|E) — revised probability of H after observing E.

Section 2 — Core formulas
- Conditional probability definition: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
- Bayes' theorem (two hypotheses): P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / [P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|not A) P(not A)]
- Bayes' theorem (general, partition {A1,...,An}): P(Ai|E) = P(Ai) P(E|Ai) / sum_j [P(Aj) P(E|Aj)]
- Extended example form (four hypotheses): P(A|Z) = P(A)P(Z|A) / [P(A)P(Z|A) + P(B)P(Z|B) + P(C)P(Z|C) + P(D)P(Z|D)]

Section 3 — Procedure to apply Bayes' theorem
1 - Identify hypothesis H and evidence E.
2 - Obtain priors P(H) and P(not H) (or P(Ai) for all hypotheses).
3 - Obtain likelihoods P(E|H) and P(E|not H) (or P(E|Ai) for all).
4 - Compute marginal P(E) = sum_j P(Aj) P(E|Aj).
5 - Compute posterior: P(H|E) = P(E|H) P(H) / P(E).
6 - Interpret result: posterior replaces prior given the evidence.

Section 4 — Worked examples (from PDF)
4.1 Orange County cigar example (credit-card survey)
- Given: P(male) = 0.51, P(female) = 0.49
- Likelihoods: P(smoke|male) = 0.095, P(smoke|female) = 0.017
- Posterior: P(male|smoke) = [0.51*0.095] / [0.51*0.095 + 0.49*0.017] = 0.853 (approx.)
- Interpretation: Observing cigar smoking increases probability subject is male.

4.2 Pregnancy test (contingency table)
- Table totals:
  - Pregnant & positive: 80
  - Pregnant & negative: 5
  - Not pregnant & positive: 3
  - Not pregnant & negative: 11
  - Totals: Pregnant = 85, Not pregnant = 14, Positive = 83, Negative = 16, N = 99
- Results:
  - P(pregnant) = 85/99 = 0.859
  - P(pregnant | positive) = 80/83 = 0.964
  - P(not pregnant) = 14/99 = 0.141
  - P(not pregnant | negative) = 11/16 = 0.6875

4.3 Pleas and sentences
- Given: P(sent to prison) = 0.45, P(not sent) = 0.55
- Likelihoods: P(guilty | prison) = 0.40, P(guilty | not prison) = 0.55
- Posteriors:
  - P(not sent) = 0.55 (prior)
  - P(not sent | guilty) = [0.55 * 0.55] / [0.55*0.55 + 0.45*0.40] = 0.627
  - Complement: P(sent | guilty) = 1 - 0.627 = 0.373

4.4 HIV screening (at-risk population)
- Given: P(HIV) = 0.10
- Test correct 95% of the time ⇒ assume:
  - P(+ | HIV) = 0.95 (sensitivity)
  - P(+ | not HIV) = 0.05 (false positive rate, assuming symmetric statement)
- Posterior if test positive:
  - P(HIV | +) = [0.10*0.95] / [0.10*0.95 + 0.90*0.05] = 0.679 (approx.)
- Posterior if test negative:
  - P(HIV | -) = [0.10*0.05] / [0.10*0.05 + 0.90*0.95] ≈ 0.0058

4.5 Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELT) — method
- Given data referenced in Exercise 4 (priors by manufacturer and defect rates).
- Example answers provided:
  - P(selected ELT from Chartair) = 0.05
  - P(Chartair | defective) = 0.0989
- Method: treat manufacturers as partition {M1,...,Mk}; apply general formula.

Section 5 — Important relationships and connections
- Posterior depends on both prior and likelihood; a small prior can be overwhelmed by strong likelihood or vice versa.
- Marginal likelihood P(E) normalizes the posterior; it aggregates contributions from all competing hypotheses.
- Bayes' theorem connects conditional probabilities P(A|B) and P(B|A).
- When tests are imperfect, high sensitivity and low prevalence can yield moderate post-test positive probabilities (illustrated by HIV example).
- Contingency tables give direct counts to compute priors, likelihoods, marginals, and posteriors.

Section 6 — Compact worked formulas and reminders
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / sum_j [P(B|Aj) P(Aj)]
- Marginal: P(B) = sum_j P(B|Aj) P(Aj)
- Complement checks: P(A|B) + P(not A|B) = 1
- When given counts: convert counts to probabilities by dividing by total N.

Section 7 — Sample answers from exercises (selected)
- Pregnancy: P(pregnant) = 85/99 = 0.859; P(pregnant|positive) = 80/83 = 0.964
- Orange County prior female: 0.49; P(female | smokes cigar) = 0.147 (example complement)
- ELT example: P(Chartair) = 0.05; P(Chartair | defective) = 0.0989
- Pleas example: P(not sent) = 0.55; P(not sent | guilty) = 0.627
- HIV positive test posterior: 0.679

Section 8 — Quick revision checklist
1 - Identify hypotheses and evidence.
2 - Write priors P(Ai).
3 - Write likelihoods P(E|Ai).
4 - Compute marginal P(E) = sum_i P(E|Ai)P(Ai).
5 - Compute posterior P(Ai|E) = P(E|Ai)P(Ai)/P(E).
6 - Verify results via complements or contingency-table totals.

Section 9 — Key takeaways
- Bayes' theorem is a tool for updating beliefs with evidence.
- Always check which probabilities are priors vs. likelihoods.
- Low prevalence can produce counterintuitive posterior probabilities even with accurate tests.
- Use the partition form for multiple competing hypotheses.
